# timeLapse
Easily makes large folders of time lapse frames
-Right now it only takes frames every 5 seconds but will add variable times in the future.
-Installation
Copy the timeLapse file into /bin/ and set its permissions to execute. Navigate to the folder where you want the frames to be stored then run the command (adding an "&" at the end will allow the process to run in the background, but you should disable output it you are going to do that)
